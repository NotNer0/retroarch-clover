# RetroArch module for hakchi

This is a hakchi/hakchi2 module which adds libretro cores and RetroArch front-end to your NES Mini.

It will automatically detect unsupported NES games and run them instead of the default emulator. Save states will work as usual.

It can also run games for other consoles. This pack already contains the following cores:
- fceumm (Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System, many mappers, UNIF support)
- nestopia (Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System, Famicom Disk System)

The following cores are available as additional modules (in core_modules folder):
- snes9x2005 (Super Famicom/Super Nintendo)
- gambatte_libretro (Game Boy, Game Boy Color)
- mgba (Game Boy Advance)
- genesis_plus_gx (Sega Master System, Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear)
- stella (Atari 2600)
- mednafen_pce_fast (PC Engine/Turbografx 16)
- fb_alpha and fb_alpha_cps2 (various arcade machines)
- picodrive (Sega Master System, Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear, Sega 32X)

## How to use this

1. Go to "releases" tab and download the newest release.zip 
2. Unpack release.zip anywhere you want
3. Copy retroarch.hmod and the cores you want (.hmod files from "cores" directory) to user_mods directory of Hakchi2.
4. Install the modules (all modules can be installed in one go) via Hakchi2's Modules menu.
5. Add the games as usual

Please note:
- To add RetroArch shortcut to NES Mini's shell, drag-and-drop CloverApp.zip to Hakchi2
- To make your own RetroArch modules, use the structure from libretro_core_template.zip. Use exisiting modules as a reference.
- To add your own BIOS images for custom cores, use bios_template.zip (please read the readme.txt inside).
- To load arcade games that come in the form of ZIP archives, you'll need to change /bin/zip in game's command line arguments to /bin/fba or /bin/cps2 depending on the core needed for the game to run (look at "Additional Information" section for all avaiable /bin/<> commands). For some cores like Final Burn Alpha, BIOS image (e.g. neogeo.zip for Neo-Geo) must be in the game directory.
- Since version 0.5, you'll need to upload neogeo.zip only once. Just put neogeo.zip to any Neo-Geo game you want, synchronize and launch it once for every other game to work automatically or just upload neogeo.zip to RA's system folder using BIOS template. You won't have to include neogeo.zip anymore unless you uninstall hakchi and decide to install it again.
- If the file extension of your game is not supported by Hakchi2, you may need to change the path in command line arguments (in Hakchi2's game options) to make it point to the corresponding core
- To use RetroArch for any NES game, just add "--retroarch" to command line arguments. If you need to specify NES core, use "--retroarch --core fceumm" to use FCEUmm for this game or "--retroarch --core nestopia" to use Nestopia
- To use Nestopia instead of FCEUmm, install use_nestopia.hmod module
- To use PicoDrive for all Genesis/Mega Drive games instead of Genesis Plus GX, install use_picodrive.hmod module. Make sure that picodrive module is installed before installing use_picodrive!
- You can re-enable bilinear filtering in RetroArch's settings (Settings —> Video —> Bilinear Filtering)
- If you want to use RetroArch's XMB UI instead of RGUI, install xmb_assets.hmod and change Menu Driver in Settings —> Driver —> Menu Driver to "xmb"

## Additional information

Executables and arguments for all available cores:

          runs RetroArch with specified core,
          designed for executing from clover shell, 
          so it parses all clover arguments (saves, aspect ratio, etc.)
